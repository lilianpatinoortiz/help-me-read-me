### ~ Module 09 - Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator  üìù
          
## Description

Motivation:
- In this challenge we created a readme generator using the inquirer library to get input from the user in the terminal along with the fs library to write/read files.

Why this project was created:
- To save us time in the future when developing a project, so we can focus on coding and not spend a lot of time recreating the readme files

What are we solving:
- We are automating a little bit the creation of the readme file, allowing the developers to spend more time in their tasks assigned. Its important to automate as much tasks as possible in our daily basis so we can use our time efficiently in the tasks that are more important.

What we learned:
- The usage of fs to write files and inquirer library
